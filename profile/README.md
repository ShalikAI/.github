# 🕊️ ShalikAI

> *Shalik* — Inspired by the alertness and adaptability of the South Asian Myna bird.

Welcome to **ShalikAI** – where the intelligence of birds meets the precision of robotics. We are a robotics research and development organization working at the intersection of:

- 🧠 Embodied AI
- 🐦 All Terrain Robot
- 🛰️ From SLAM to Spatial AI  
- 🤲 Dexterous Manipulation
- ⚙️ Adaptive Locomotion

Our work is rooted in both academic rigor and real-world deployment, aiming to build intelligent, adaptable, and context-aware robotic systems.
